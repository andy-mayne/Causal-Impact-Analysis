st.markdown('''This tool can be used to work out the possible causal effect of an intervention on a time series. 
For example, how many more patient discharges can we acheive since changing the patient pathway? Answering a question like this can be difficult when a randomised experiment is not possible. 
Causal Impact Analysis aims to address this by estimating what would have happened after the intervention if the intervention had not occurred.

As with all approaches to causal inference on non-experimental data, valid conclusions require strong assumptions. Causal Impact in particular, assumes that the outcome can be explained by something not 
affected by the intervention. Furthermore, the relation between treated series and control series is assumed to be stable during the post-intervention period. Understanding and checking these assumptions for any given application is critical for obtaining valid conclusions.''')
